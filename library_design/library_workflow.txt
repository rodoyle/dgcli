Library Creation

1. Gene list obtained from client 
  -> clean up to form canonical gene list (embl ids)
    -> get gene sequences and CDS annotations

2. Locate/ Filter guides - use Ensembl sequences/annotations


3. Score exons/ score guides
  -> score exons - find most commonly expressed consensus exon(s)
  -> on-target scoring - use Doench tool
  -> off-target scoring:
    -> find guide matches in genome (allowing for up to 4 mismatches)
    -> apply MIT (Zhang) off-target scoring algorithm

4. Select guides
  -> use scores and location to find best guides

5. Guide list output for client
  -> provide client with csv guide list and calculated parameters
  -> some sort of visual representation:
    my idea was a per-gene graphic showing guide position within CDS and scores
